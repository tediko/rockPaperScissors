# Rock, paper, scissors!

A simple game whose rules everyone knows. The user chooses one of three options and fights with a computer that randomly chooses its own. The result of each fight will be recorded on the scoreboard, and the choice of each player will be displayed on the screen as a text and hand images containing animations. The game starts from the [menu](#menu), which directs us to the game [settings](#settings--final-screen) where you can set name of the player, the avatar, and the limit of points to which the match will be played. When one of the players reaches this limit, the [victory/loss screen](#settings--final-screen)  is displayed with a play again function.
